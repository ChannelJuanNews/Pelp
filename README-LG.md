### Synopsis
  
You can already rate anything from restaurants to mom-and-pop shops to movies and music and everything in-between.  Pelp allows you to rate people on a personal, professional, and/or romantic level. The reviews can then be used to find a better dating match, job match, or just a networking opportunity. This app was not created to put people down or to harass anyone or degrade anyoneâ€™s character. We want to be a safe place for everyone to gain better knowledge of the people they come in contact with, whether it was a positive or negative experience. ### How It Works
Once you login with Facebook or create a new account, you can learn about people you know by searching through our users. You may assign reviews and 1-5 star ratings to everyone you know, and others can review you as well.### Technologies

### Improvements
